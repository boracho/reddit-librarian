# reddit-librarian
finds specified topics in one subreddit and posts them to another.  great for creating a collection of articles and reddit submissions for later consumption.  just supply the username and password for the bot, subreddit to search, the keywords/topics to look for and the subreddit to post the findings to.
could use some tweaking;
  -ability to scan more than one subreddit for more than one topic/keyword
  -use of threading to accomplish the above
  -a database to store already posted urls/submissions ids.  The json method works well enough, but there are better ways to do it
